# evg
This is the primary game module for the Everglades Project, and was generated by Unreal Engine 
to register and implement the game module. This class consists only of a single macro. As this 
class is not Everglades-specific, other than in name, more information can be seen in Unreal's 
documentation,  found [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Programming/Modules/Gameplay/index.html).
